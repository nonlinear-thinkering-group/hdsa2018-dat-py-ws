# h&dsa 2018 ws proposal

## What's your current occupation?

We both are hybrid designers and programmers. At the moment, we are working together [on tools](https://github.com/nonlinear-thinkering-group) to bring thinking and complex ideas exploration into an actual hypertext format.

## What's the workshop about? 

(Explain the theme or main topic of your workshop)

Exploring the p2p [dat protocol](https://datproject.org/) protocol by way of setting up a small p2p mesh network using raspberry pies running the dat software.

We will then use this for different purposes: as a dropbox alternative that can be used throughout the summer academy, as a simple site-builder using [enoki](https://enoki.site) and [beaker browser](https://beakerbrowser.com/), and chatting throughout the whole process with [Rotonde](https://louis.center/p2p-social-networking/).

## Tell us your motivation to organise this workshop 

(In short, write why you think this workshop would be relevant for this year's edition of H&D Summer Academy)

In the context of online / offline and p2p networks, as well as fake news and post-truth realities, we want to work on showing: 

- the difference between the internet and the web
- how offline p2p groups can still be fully computer networked but not dependent on internet providers to communicate
- and in general spreading knowledge and know-how on the wave of p2p experiments happening at the moment.

## What do you think other participants will learn?

- web ≠ internet
- offline / online
- getting introduced to one of the many p2p protocols being developed at the moment and its very different applications
- the collapse between client and server when using p2p technologies
- separation between user data and user application and how user data can flow between apps when using the right protocol

## Do you expect a certain outcome? 

(What do you want to get out of this workshop and how would it contribute to the Hackers & Designers Community)

All in all, we want to build and use a p2p mesh network.

In terms of contributions, we aim to: 

- make people willing to explore more dat as well as other p2p protocols (such as scuttlebutt), as viable alternatives to major internet companies
- give an introduction to fiddling with p2p tools, the command line, forking websites, provide ways to change your computing habits

## What are the requirements for your workshop?

(Technical conditions, required materials, equipment or technical support)

- raspberry pi
  - power supply
  - sd card with raspian (pre-installed?). Doing this could take some time + you need an sd-card reader in your laptop
  - it's possible to work [headless](https://howtoraspberrypi.com/how-to-raspberry-pi-headless-setup/) via `ssh`, by using an ethernet cable (which depends if your laptop even has one), or preconfigure the wifi connection on the sd-card.
- laptop w/ Beaker Browser and dat installed
- basic terminal knowledge (for whom is interested, GUI alternatives for the most part)

Participants can form group and share each a raspberry pi.

## What's the duration?

- [ ] Half-day
- [x] 1 Day
- [ ] 2 Days

I’d say 1 day to have enough time to explore and play a bit with stuff once everything has been setup?

## We ask everyone who submits a workshop proposal to review proposals of peers as well. How many proposals are you able to review in the week of May 14th to May 20th?

- [ ] 1
- [x] 2
- [ ] 3
- [ ] No reviews

One each?
