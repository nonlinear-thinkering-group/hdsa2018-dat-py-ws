## What's your current occupation?

We both are hybrid designers and programmers. We are working together [on tools](https://github.com/nonlinear-thinkering-group) for new approaches to computers.

## What's the workshop about? 

(Explain the theme or main topic of your workshop)

We want to build a p2p mesh network, using raspberry pies that run the p2p [dat protocol](https://datproject.org/) software. We will then use this for different purposes: as a dropbox alternative that can be used throughout the summer academy, as a simple site-builder using [enoki](https://enoki.site), as a local chat / social network with [Rotonde](https://louis.center/p2p-social-networking/).

## Tell us your motivation to organise this workshop 

(In short, write why you think this workshop would be relevant for this year's edition of H&D Summer Academy)

In the context of online / offline and p2p networks, as well as fake news and post-truth realities, we want to work on showing the difference between the internet and the web, how offline p2p groups can still be fully computer networked but not dependent on internet providers to communicate, and in general spread knowledge and know-how on the wave of p2p experiments happening at the moment.

## What do you think other participants will learn?

- web ≠ internet
- offline / online
- getting introduced to one of the many p2p protocols being developed at the moment and its very different applications
- the collapse between client and server when using p2p technologies
- separation between user data and user application and how user data can flow between apps with the right protocol

## Do you expect a certain outcome? 

(What do you want to get out of this workshop and how would it contribute to the Hackers & Designers Community)

- building and use a p2p mesh network
- people willing to explore more dat as well as other p2p protocols (such as scuttlebutt), as viable alternative to major internet companies
- introduction to fiddling with p2p tools, the command line, forking websites, etc

## What are the requirements for your workshop?

(Technical conditions, required materials, equipment or technical support)

- raspberry pi
	- power supply
	- sd card with raspian (pre-installed?). Doing this could take some time + you need an sd-card reader in your laptop
	- it's possible to work [headless](https://howtoraspberrypi.com/how-to-raspberry-pi-headless-setup/) via `ssh`, by using an ethernet cable (which depends if your laptop even has one), or preconfigure the wifi connection on the sd-card.
- laptop w/ Beaker Browser and dat installed
- basic terminal knowledge

Participants can form group and share each a raspberry pi. Then use multiple laptops with Beaker Browser to upload material and browse the dats running on the raspberry pies.

## What's the duration?

- [ ] Half-day
- [x] 1 Day
- [ ] 2 Days

I’d say 1 day to have enough time to explore and play a bit with stuff once everything has been setup?

## We ask everyone who submits a workshop proposal to review proposals of peers as well. How many proposals are you able to review in the week of May 14th to May 20th?

- [ ] 1
- [x] 2
- [ ] 3
- [ ] No reviews

One each?
