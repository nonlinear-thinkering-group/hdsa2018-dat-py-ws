## What's your current occupation?

We both are hybrid designers and programmers. We are working together on tools like computational cosmogony (should we say this?)

## What's the workshop about? 

(Explain the theme or main topic of your workshop)

We want to build a p2p mesh network, using raspberry pies that run the dat protocol. We will then use this as a dropbox alternative that can be used throughout the summer academy, as well as a simple site-builder using [enoki](https://enoki.site).

## Tell us your motivation to organise this workshop 

(In short, write why you think this workshop would be relevant for this year's edition of H&D Summer Academy)

In the context of online/offline and p2p networks, as well as fake news and post-truth realities, we want to work on showing the difference between the internet and the web, how offline peer2peer groups are still fully connected but not dependent on internet providers to communicate, and in general giving an introduction to {{data ownership and integrity}}{{ too much? dat can do this through versioning etc, could be a little tangent to touch upon during the introduction? }}.

## What do you think other participants will learn?

- web â‰  internet
- offline / online
- using small computers
- learning how to setup a personal server
- getting introduced to one of the many p2p protocols being developed at the moment
- the collapse between client and server when using p2p technologies

## Do you expect a certain outcome? 

(What do you want to get out of this workshop and how would it contribute to the Hackers & Designers Community)

- people willing to explore more dat as well as other p2p protocols (such as scuttlebutt), as viable alternative to to major internet companies.
- Introduction to fiddling with p2p servers, the command line, forking websites, etc

## What are the requirements for your workshop?

(Technical conditions, required materials, equipment or technical support)

- raspberry pi
- laptop w/ Beaker Browser and dat installed
- basic terminal knowledge

Participants can form group and share each a raspberry pi. Then use multiple laptops with Beaker Browser to upload material and browse the dat(s) running on the raspberry pi(es).
