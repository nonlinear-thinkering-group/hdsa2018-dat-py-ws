# glossary

A few relevant keywords from the [glossary of bittorent terms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_BitTorrent_terms), to adopt and adjust based on the p2p protocol at hand:

- `hash`: the hash is a string of alphanumeric characters (typically hexadecimal) in the .torrent file that the client uses to verify the data that is being transferred. "hash" is the shorter form of the word "hashsum".
- `distribued hash table`: a distributed hash table (dht) is a class of a decentralized distributed system that provides a lookup service similar to a hash table; (key, value) pairs are stored in a dht, and any participating node can efficiently retrieve the value associated with a given key. responsibility for maintaining the mapping from keys to values is distributed among the nodes, in such a way that a change in the set of participants causes a minimal amount of disruption. this allows a dht to scale to extremely large numbers of nodes and to handle continual node arrivals, departures, and failures.
- `peer`: a peer is one instance of a bittorrent client running on a computer on the internet to which other clients connect and transfer data. depending on context, "peer" can refer either to any client in the swarm or more specifically to a downloader, a client that has only parts of the file.
- `seed`: a seed refers to a machine possessing some part of the data. a peer or downloader becomes a seed when it starts uploading the already downloaded content for other peers to download from. when a downloader starts uploading content, the peer becomes a seed. seeding refers to leaving a peer's bittorrent client open and available for additional individuals to download from.
- `leech`: leech has two meanings: 1. simply describing a peer or any client that does not have 100% of the data; 2. the term leech also refers to a peer (or peers) that has a negative effect on the swarm by having a very poor share ratio, downloading much more than they upload. leeches may be on asymmetric internet connections or do not leave their bittorrent client open to seed the file after their download has completed. however, some leeches intentionally avoid uploading by using modified clients or excessively limiting their upload speed.
- `lurker`: a lurker is a user that only downloads files from the group but does not add new content. it does not necessarily mean that the lurker will not seed. not to be confused with a leecher.
- `swarm`: together, all peers sharing a torrent are called a swarm. this is a holdover from the predecessor to bittorrent, a program called swarmcast, originally from opencola.
