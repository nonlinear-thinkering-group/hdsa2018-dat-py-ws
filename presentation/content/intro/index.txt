- p2p vs http
- p2p => visiting files
- http => visiting locations that serve files
- p2p => turns any computer into a node of the network
- eg. torrenting movies and music
- you can just simply connect with other computers (publish and share stuff, working on same files, broadcasting, etc); you are using your own computation power instead of using dedicated computers acting as servers; 
- good alternative to most silicon-valley applications (distributed network rather than centralised gateways - rather than servers, because server farms and cdns) 
- lan vs blockchain
- RAND corp graph (add context)
- decentralised + small distributed nodes
- [hierarchical network model](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical_network_model)
